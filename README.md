# unity-3.x-car-tutorial

The good old Unity car tutorial.  

The Unity 3.x car tutorial is not found on the Unity website of Asset Store any more. But here it is!  
  
Note that the tutorial likely will not run on Unity 4.x or above because of deprecated code. However I think this is still a good source for some assets.
